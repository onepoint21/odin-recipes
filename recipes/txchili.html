        What sets authentic Texas chili apart from the rest of the crowd? It deliciously enforces a no-bean rule. This recipe utilizes braised beef that would be used in stews as well as ancho chiles, and even a little beer. Let these spicy flavors warm up your house over a cold weekend to add some comfort to dinner.

        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 12oz bottle dark beer, such as Shiner Bock or Modelo Negro</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons masa harina</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional serving options</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn chips or tortilla chips</li>
        <li>Cornbread</li>
        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Diced white onion</li>
        <li>Sliced fresh jalape√±os</li>
        <li>Sour cream or plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Here's how to make it</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the following, adding each to the same large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven as you complete it: Remove the stems and seeds from 3 dried guajillo, 3 dried pasilla, and 2 dried ancho chilis. Coarsely chop 6 garlic cloves. Add 2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, if using, and 2 cups of the low-sodium beef broth. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Cover and let steep until the chilis are softened and plump, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, dice 1 large white onion (about 2 cups). Trim 1 (4 1/2-pound) boneless beef chuck roast of any gristle and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Season the beef with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chili mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in the now-empty pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 3 batches, add the beef in a single layer and sear undisturbed until the bottom of the beef develops a dark brown crust, about 4 minutes. Stir and continue cooking until browned all over, about 4 minutes more. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a large plate. Repeat searing the remaining beef and transferring to the plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the onion to the pot (and a drizzle of oil, if the pot is dry) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook until the onions are softened and browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar, 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add 12 ounces dark beer and 3 tablespoons masa harina, and repeat scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Pour in the blended chiles and remaining 2 cups beef broth. Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Partially cover and simmer, stirring every 20 minutes or so, until the beef is fork-tender but not falling apart, about 2 hours. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed. Serve with desired garnishes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Make ahead:</strong> Texas chili can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container. Reheat on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of water as needed to thin out the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.</li>
    </ul>
