            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly-grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional serving options</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Homemade garlic bread</li>
        <li>Simple side salad</li>
        <li>Cucumber tomato salad</li>
        <li>Roasted asparagus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Here's how to make it</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook
            until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water,
            then drain well. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the chicken:</strong> Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to
            evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is
            golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a
            gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165
            degrees F.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent
            with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</strong> In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream;
            whisk until butter has melted.</li>
        <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and
            smooth.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to
            thicken.</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add
            some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more
            Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Make ahead:</strong> Chicken Alfredo is ideally made and served right away, however the chicken can
            be cooked up to 1 day in advance. I don’t recommend making the sauce ahead of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Any leftovers should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It
            should be good for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Instructions to reheat:</strong> Reheat on the stovetop, gently over low heat until it's
            incorporated, keeping in mind that the sauce will likely separate.</li>
    </ul>
